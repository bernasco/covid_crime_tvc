Analyses for covid-crime manuscript prepared for TvC special issue

The manuscript (in Dutch) was prepared for a special issue of the journal Tijdschrift voor Criminologie.

The analyses estimate crime volumes of 16 crime types during 2012-2019 using SARIMA time series models with automatic model selection. The model estimates are subsequently used to counterfactually forecast crime volumes during the COVID pandemic. Finally, the forecast are compared with the observed crime volumes.
